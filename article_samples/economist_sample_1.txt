pakistani side of the line of control pakistan claim that the aircraft had been fli over pakistani kashmir but thi wa deni by india whatev actual happen the use by india of air power so close to pakistan s side may be view as a threat if not an act of outright aggress when scenariospinn envisag how a nuclear war might start the open sequenc gener involv some such action pakistan s foreign ministri say pakistan doe not want the situat to escal but the risk of accid and misunderstand and even a new war are high the shoot season in kashmir normal begin in the earli month of the year when the snow melt and milit cross the mountain pass to renew their campaign to wrest india s muslimmajor state from delhi s control thi spring s violenc is unusu for two reason It follow a dramat peaceseek bu trip to pakistan that the indian prime minist atal behari vajpaye made in februari that seem to have put the two countri relat on a friendlier foot and indian offici certainli hope that a quieter border would be one consequ instead the incurs is more menac than usual accord to india s version of event 540680 milit most of them underemploy taliban fighter from afghanistan cross the line of control after an earli thaw and took up posit near the town of kargil and drass In some place their posit overlook the road that link srinagar the capit of jammu kashmir the formal name for the indian state to leh the main town of it ladakh region the infiltr have dug into posit up to six kilometr four mile insid indian territori that look to india like a pakistani attempt to redraw the de facto border in contravent of a 1972 agreement such highaltitud conquest india think requir help from the pakistan armi in the form of radar mortar and snowmobil among other thing It also took advanc plan which must have been go on while the two prime minist were embrac each other in lahor india claim that some regular pakistani armi troop are among the invad whi is war break out just three month after Mr vajpaye and nawaz sharif hi pakistani counterpart promis peac pakistan s offici line is that it is not involv the height near kargil are occupi not by import mujahideen still less by pakistani troop but by indigen freedom fighter pakistan accus india of unprovok shell that is kill civilian across the line of control but pakistani offici hardli seem to expect their denial to be fulli believ A littleknown pakistanbas milit group ha reportedli claim credit for the infiltr In the absenc of fact specul ha flourish india s nationalsecur advis brajesh mishra wonder aloud whether Mr sharif knew what the armi wa plan other think he ha embark on a kashmiri adventur to distract attent from hi crackdown against the press which ha provok foreign and domest clamour anoth theori is that pakistan is tri to provok intern intervent in a conflict that india want to keep strictli bilater then there is guess that pakistan might pull back in exchang for an indian retreat in siachen a glacier over which the two countri have been fight whatev the truth the clash suggest that the talk in lahor did not resolv the danger mismatch between indian and pakistani approach to talk about kashmir To pakistan the kashmiri right to selfdetermin  remain the core issu between the two countri pakistan accus india of talk about almost anyth but that which is whi it must keep appli the pressur If there is a declin in the level of milit in kashmir  say khalid mahmud an analyst at the institut of region studi in islamabad india will back out of the dialogu  the indian view is exactli the revers progress on kashmir will start not with dialogu but with a reduct in pakistanexport violenc fail that india must show that it selfdef can be both ruthless and restrict that is the point of the air oper evict the intrud from their mountain redoubt with ground forc alon wa begin to look like a protract and expens task By may 25th said offici 17 indian soldier had die and 90 had been injur surgic air strike may have seem a quicker and safer way to accomplish the job they may also be a way of shield india s Mr vajpaye who face an elect thi year from charg by the opposit that militari neglect encourag the incurs in the first place success would allow india to claim that it can be as tough as it need to be on kashmir without provok a wider war but that is not the same as make peac the incid is like to harden both countri posit on kashmir pakistan will continu tri to prove that kashmir is a big deal while india strive to show that it is a manag problem the cycl is like to go on becaus the cost have so far been toler about 200 indian soldier die everi year and the invad revel in martyrdom the danger is that each time they clash even by proxi they risk turn strategi into war
