nation constitut napoleon bonapart said should be short and obscur  had the sometim emperor himself onli been content with that same condit a million fallen soldier would still be aliv today instead though short beyond reproach he ha been everyth save obscur He ha march far enough and fought long enough to turn all europ into a battlefield selfproclaim an emperor here and there the instal of hi brother and marshal as it king he ha shaken the contin so violent that he may well have unbalanc it natur order for decad to come the worst of the nightmar is over bonapart is aboard a british warship under guard and head into exil He is bound for the south atlant where he will live out hi day on the island of St helena with a dozen servant and a gener s halfpay mani view thi as too gener a fate and they have a case If the ruler of europ had sent bonapart to the gallow instead law and natur justic alik would have smile on hi execut and conceiv he may have mischief within him yet nobodi foresaw hi capac less than six month ago to escap from a first exil in elba and to rais yet anoth armi in franc that adventur bought him a hundr day of freedom europ paid for it with 100000 live but there is a compel argument for er on the side of clemenc which britain doe well to heed Of cours bonapart is a bad man Of cours he is a danger man but he is also an except man who ha divert devastatingli the cours of european histori He ha put himself in british hand for fear of wors To execut him would smack of petti not justic and St helena unlik elba is far enough remov from franc to ensur there can be no second escap all of which is not to wish hi most corsican majesti a long and happi retir far from it He deserv the fathomless privat torment which an honest recollect of hi life would bring let us hope the baggag accompani him into exil includ at least one of those flatter portrait by gro or david show the first consul lean and brightey on the field of an earli battl and on St helena let thi hang next to a long mirror so that old boney by name but no longer by natur can weep each morn at the evid of hi declin bare 45 year of age he ha slump from the figur of a young greek god to that of a sickli and sagbelli pension doubtless bonapart will prefer dishonest reflect He can spend the long even which remain to him write letter and memoir which will justifi hi action when in power He can devis tale of other treacheri and of the cruel of fate to explain away hi defeat thi may win over some reader but it is to be doubt whether bonapart could in fact tell much of valu about the caus of hi rise and fall even should he want genuin to do so He wa a shrewd and tireless opportunist of undoubt militari gift but one whose hunger for power and wealth wa never match by a capac for manag those commod onc acquir in an intellig and durabl way such polit insight as he possess were those suppli by hi experi of the french revolut He watch it mutat into mobrul and corrupt He seem to have come away persuad that violenc alon could determin human affair and that all other statecraft wa mere the decor conceal of thi basic truth He treat other men as worthless or close to it when necessari they could alway be bribe or kill We may say on hi behalf that thi simpl view of the world allow him onc in power to pursu two gener and complementari aim the first wa to impos civil order at home the second wa to conquer and loot other countri at the rate need to sustain an armi larg enough to see off ani challeng it wa ever like to encount He rose for a time becaus these were not in truth bad polici for franc He fell when the second of them prove unsustain and began to threaten the first hi polici at home wa to favour new  money as the keyston of hi order mean in practic the promot of poor men who had grown rich through the opportun for theft afford by govern or militari servic the vulgar and licenti of thi new class ha given much innoc amus to the rest of europ one need not spend much time chez the first duchess of danzig to guess at mme lefebvr s earlier career as a washerwoman but thi wa a class splendidli admir of bonapart so long as he wa win hi battl In hi gift then lay the loot and exot titl which they crave the troubl came when he start lose He discov that he had invent a gentri almost as cynic as he wa himself they care noth for an emperor who began to cost them money now nobless oblig these new french seem happi to resum life under loui the umpteenth so long as he invit them to court and tax onli the poor If he disappoint on either count they will in anoth decad or two contriv some other regim that suit them better one sens in franc after bonapart a countri where great entrepreneuri energi ha been unleash but vitiat by a danger streak of silli elsewher in europ the danger is that too littl cynic may prevail bonapart ha instal in franc the institut of a modern state those of administr of law of financ of civil and militari educationthes may outlast him inde hi and our centuri thank to him and them the whole contin ha glimps the possibl inher in a wellfunct modern tyranni clearli the finest system of govern imagin so long as one care noth for human the main structur flaw in bonapart s tyranni wa that it had no great caus no great idea to sustain it It had noth but the exhort of the tyrant himself We may revil him rightli for hi cynic and selfish but imagin how much more aw europ s next tyranni will be if it is ideal that drive it
